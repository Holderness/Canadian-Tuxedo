#Juxtapose!

---
Juxtapose is a fashion app for urbanites who have decision paralysis when choosing an outfit. It crowd-sources recommendations for what look is best. Unlike other online wardrobe apps, it incorporates a social element. 

Users of Juxtapose will be able to: 
- Upload images of items in their closet, with the option of adding tags
- Create a "look" by combining clothing items together (i.e. pants, shirt, scrarf, shoes). The "look" will also have the option of adding tags.
- Search for other user's looks by clicking a tag
- Edit a clothing item or look 
- Delete a clothing item or look 
- Scroll through a "discover" newsfeed page to view looks that other user's have uploaded.
- On this "discover" page, users will also have the option to vote yes or no on a look that other users have uploaded.



Upon opening the application, the Home Page will allow a new user to register with their username and password.
